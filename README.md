# React + Typescript TODO Application

The classic To-Do application where a user can write down all the things he wants to accomplish.

## User Stories

- [ ] User can see an `input` field where he can type in a to-do item
- [ ] By pressing enter (or a button), the User can submit the to-do item and can see that being added to a list of to-do's
- [ ] User can mark a to-do as `completed`
- [ ] User can remove a to-do item by pressing on a button (or on the to-do item itself)
- [ ] Remove all list that are completed with a button
- [ ] User can see a list with all the completed to-do's
- [ ] User can see a list with all the active to-do's
- [ ] When closing the browser window the to-do's will be stored and when the User returns, the data will be retrieved
- [ ] Implement a drag and drop system to move the order of to-do's

There is a challenge from a user called [florinpop17](https://github.com/florinpop17/), who proposes [a challenge with similar characteristics](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/To-Do-App.md), with which I will make modifications to this repository in the future.
